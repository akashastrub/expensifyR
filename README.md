# expensifyR (personal finances) app

The app is currently hosted [here]( https://pxzy9z-akashastrub.shinyapps.io/expensifyr/).

## Disclaimer

As of now, a first version of the 'master' and 'category_dict' files needs to be 
created manually, ensuring the column names, formats, etc. are strictly adhered to. 
This means new users can only be onboarded with the help of the developers, or
by reverse engineering the data structure in the demo files in this repo.
It is a feature on the issues list to add a tab for streamlined onboarding.

## Instructions

The app should be self-explanatory. If anything is unclear, please report an issue
on the issues list of this repository, or contact me [here](mailto:akashastrub@gmail.com).
