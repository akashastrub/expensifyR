# Personal Finances app

## Instructions

N.B. a first version of the 'master' file needs to be created manually. Ensure 
the columns, column formats etc. are strictly adhered to. Ensure a 'category_dict'
file is also created accordingly, with the correct directions and categories also 
included.

N.B. The folder structure should also be adhered to,

1) As a first step, download all relevant bank statements and add them to the 
data/new_raw_bank_data folder following the same naming convention as past entries. 
Should a new bank/currency format be required, a new script will need to be 
created in the src/import_bank_currency_functions.

2) Once the above is taken care of, run the app to add the new bank data to a 
new version of 'master'.
