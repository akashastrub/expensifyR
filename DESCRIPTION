Description: The expensifyR Shiny app allows users to easily manage their expenses.
    It includes functions to import raw data downloaded from your bank, compile
    these into one dataframe, predict their category based on past data, and 
    visualisation tools to track your spending patterns. This tool is especially 
    relevant for expats with expenses across multiple countries, banks, 
    currencies and formats.
